   - Read `{{.CVPath}}` - job titles, dates, responsibilities

2. **Analyze match across:**
   - Experience years required vs actual
   - Technical skills alignment (cite specific gaps from reference files)
   - Domain knowledge fit
   - Role type alignment
   - Career direction fit

3. **Provide honest assessment:**
   - Rate match: Strong/Moderate/Weak/Poor
   - Strengths with ✓
   - Gaps with ❌ (cite specific missing skills from reference)
   - Clear recommendation with reasoning
   - Strategic advice on positioning if applying

**Be direct about gaps. Reference the candidate's documented boundaries explicitly.**
